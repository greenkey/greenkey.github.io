I wanted a guide to start using Django.


I also wanted a guide with a good approach, something that could give me a good understanding of some methodology like TDD.


I found [Test-Driven Development with Python](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/), aka *Obey the Testing Goat!*.

It is awesome. not only it introduces you to Django one step at a time, but it does it using [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), something I cannot anything without anymore.


Read it, and let me know what you think!
